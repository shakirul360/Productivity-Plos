# Productivity-Plos

This repository contains experiments, analyses, and explainability work related to **machine learning models** applied for productivity-related research.  
The project is organized into structured directories, each highlighting a different stage of the workflow â€” from preprocessing raw data to running experiments, analyzing statistical patterns, and applying explainable AI techniques.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

### 1. Classification Experimentation
This directory contains Jupyter notebooks representing the **experimentation with classification models**.  
- Models are trained, tested, and optimized for best performance.  
- Includes comparisons of different architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics.  

---

### 2. Data Pre-processing
This directory contains the **data preprocessing notebooks**, where raw datasets are curated and cleaned for experimentation.  
- Handling of missing values, outliers, and inconsistent entries.  
- Feature engineering and normalization.  
- Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.  

---

### 3. Statistical Analysis
This directory includes notebooks that demonstrate the **statistical tests performed** to uncover insights and patterns in the dataset.  
- Hypothesis testing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- Distribution checks and correlation analyses.  
- Statistical validation of observed trends.  

---

### 4. XAI LIME
This directory explores **explainable AI (XAI)** using **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**.  
- Identifies key features influencing ML model predictions.  
- Provides interpretability to otherwise "black-box" models.  
- Helps validate whether the model relies on meaningful patterns.
